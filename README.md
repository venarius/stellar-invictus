Welcome to the [stellar-invictus.com](https://stellar-invictus.com) codebase. We are so excited to have you. With your help, we can build out Stellar Invictus to be more stable and better serve our community.

## What is Stellar Invictus?

Stellar Invictus is a sandbox browsergame to be played right in the browser where players fly spaceships, fight each other and trade. The game offers many ways to explore its universe.

## Contribution guideline

### Create an issue

Nobody's perfect. Something doesn't work? Or could be done better? Let us know by creating an issue.

PS: a clear and detailed issue gets lots of love, all you have to do is follow the issue template!

#### Clean code with tests

Some existing code may be poorly written or untested, so we must have more scrutiny going forward. We test with [rspec](http://rspec.info/), let us know if you have any questions about this!

#### Create a pull request

- Try to keep the pull requests small. A pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.
- Make sure all tests pass and add additional tests for the code you submit.
- Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did. The code should explain what it does.
- If there's an existing issue related to the pull request, reference to it by adding something like `References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #305`, where 305 is the issue number. [More info here](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests)
- If you follow the pull request template, you can't go wrong.

_Please note: all commits in a pull request will be squashed when merged, but when your PR is approved and passes our CI, it will be live on production!_

### The bottom line
